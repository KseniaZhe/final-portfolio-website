# Final portfolio website

## Overview

**Make it perfect!** This project gives you a chance to improve your portfolio website—a few solid weeks of pure improvement to make sure it’s amazing and stands out among your peers’ websites.

**Really sweat all the details—it should be dripping with sweaty, awesome—*you*—details.**

*If **JavaScript** will help **improve** your website now is the time to add it—but if JavaScript creates distractions don’t add any.*

**You will get really bad marks for non-functional JavaScript—if you can’t execute it well, don’t do any.**

*p.s. — don’t forget a favicon.*

### Critiques

We’ll be performing critiques to get a grade for this project. *More details below, in the “Hand-in” section.*

*There will be two weeks where critiques can be performed: Week 14 or Week 15. Pick whichever week works best for you.*

---

## Browser testing

In class, week 15, we will be doing lots of peer testing—most of the website needs to be complete by then.

Each person will be assigned a browser or validator and will be required to test everybody’s websites.

## Marking rubric

Below is the rubric of expectations for this project. **You will be assigned a letter grade based on your standing within the rubric.**

| | 0 points | 1 points | 2 points | 3 points |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Details** | No sweating | Some details sweat | Sweat all the details | Disgusting, dripping, sweaty details |
| **Pages & images** | Barely started | Missing lots of pages & images | Has most of the pages, some placeholder images | All pages exist and are well done with complete imagery |
| **Personality & design** | Bland, boring, just another graphic designer | Fairly generic, visual design could be pushed more | Quality layouts and unique, personable content & design | Unique and recognizable as you, with engaging, personable content & design |
| **Image quality** | Only placeholder images | Some portfolio piece images | Lots of images but low quality | High quality portfolio images — and lots of them |
| **Accessibility** | No considerations | Added some alt attributes, nothing else | Just the basics: alt attributes, roles | Accessibility is well considered and tested |
| **Text content** | Fake content only | Some real content, some fake | All real content but with lots of errors | Real content, well written, no grammar or spelling errors |
| **Responsiveness** | Not responsive | Works on some screens | Responsive but with lots of awkwardness | Looks great on all screen sizes |
| **Performance** | Mega slow… | Slow… | Could load faster | Blazing fast awesomeness |
| **JavaScript<br>(If it exists)** | Completely broken | Semi-functional | Works okay but the non-JavaScript experience is better | Very much improves the experience |
| **Code quality** | Barely started | Indentation is barely existent, lots of validation errors, very poor semantics | Decent indentation, just a couple validation errors, decent semantics | Well indented, fully valid, good semantics |

### Get critiques & grade yourself

To receive a grade on the interactive wireframes you’ll need to:

- [ ] **Get 3 peer critiques**
- [ ] **Fill out the rubric**
- [ ] **Write a personal performance rationale**
- [ ] **Get the teacher’s critique**
- [ ] **Determine a grade**

#### 3 peer critiques

Select 3 of your peers and get them to [critique your project ➔](/courses/shared/peer-evaluation/)

Also consider performing [usability tests ➔](topics/usability-testing-checklist/)

#### Fill out the rubric

Using the rubric above, [copy the code](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/acgd-webdev-5/final-portfolio-website/gh-pages/rubric.md) to a GitHub Issue, attached to your repository, and select the appropriate grade for each section.

Sum the values of the rubric & put that at the bottom of the Issue.

#### Personal performance rationale

As a GitHub Issue, attached to your repository, write a short-ish rationale explaining how well you did completing your project:

- What did you do well?
- What did you do poorly?
- What could be improved?
- What problems did you run into?
- What complications did you overcome?
- Does the website communicate the right message?
- Is the website usable?

#### Teacher critique

Meet with the teacher in class and get a critique of your project.

#### Determine a grade

Using all the above information, assign yourself a grade that reflects everything you’ve completed.

Discuss this grade with the teacher—if it’s fair & honest the teacher will assign the grade immediately.
