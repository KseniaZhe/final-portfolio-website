# Final portfolio website

## Overview

**Make it perfect!** This project gives you a chance to improve your portfolio website—a few solid weeks of pure improvement to make sure it’s amazing and stands out among your peers’ websites.

**Really sweat all the details—it should be dripping with sweaty, awesome—*you*—details.**

*If **Javascript** will help **improve** your website now is the time to add it—but if Javascript creates distractions don’t add any.*

**You will get really bad marks for non-functional Javascript—if you can’t execute it well, don’t do any.**

*p.s. — don’t forget a favicon.*

## Browser testing

In class, week 15, we will be doing lots of peer testing—most of the website needs to be complete by then.

Each person will be assigned a browser or validator and will be required to test everybody’s websites.

| **Image quality** | Only placeholder images | Some portfolio piece images | Lots of images but low quality | High quality portfolio images — and lots of them |
| **Accessibility** | No considerations | Added some alt attributes, nothing else | Just the basics: alt attributes, roles | Accessibility is well considered and tested |
| **Text content** | Fake content only | Some real content, some fake | All real content but with lots of errors | Real content, well written, no grammar or spelling errors |

| **Performance** | Mega slow… | Slow… | Could load faster | Blazing fast awesomeness |
| **Javascript<br>(If it exists)** | Completely broken | Semi-functional | Works okay but the non-Javascript experience is better | Very much improves the experience |
